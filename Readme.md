JS:

Encapsulation:
==============
+  Encapsulation is defineds as wrapping up of data and metohds in single entity(unit)

Abstraction:
============

+ Abstraction is the way of hiding the implementation and showing only the functionality to users

Inheritance:
============

+ Inheritance is the process of acquiring data from parent class to child class
+ Single level A-->B
+ Multi-level A-->B --> C
+ Hierarchy  A-->B & A-->C
+ Multiple Inhertance A,C -->B (Not supported in JS)
+ Inheritance we can get in js by using extend key word

Polymorphism:
============
+ Polymorphism is the ability to create variable,function or object that contains more than one form
+ `super` keyword is used to get parent class method

Filter function:
=================

+ The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function)
+ It doesn't change the value of current array

Map:
====
+ The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.

Diffrence between filter and map function:
------------------------------------------
 + filter() returns a subset of the elements from the original array, while . map() produces an array with new, different entries based on the elements in the original array

 Difference between foreach and map function:
 --------------------------------------------
 + forEach() — executes a provided function once for each array element.
 + map() — creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
